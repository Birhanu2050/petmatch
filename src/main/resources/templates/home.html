		ABOUT US We know that meeting new people is a challenge, but what
		about finding other dogs for breeding or just playmates for your dog?
		That was nearly an impossibility—at least until now. We created
		DoggiesMatch to make meeting new people and dogs in easier than ever
		before. DoggiesMatch is the ultimate online destination for dog lovers
		to connect with others just like them in a unique way—a dog dating
		site if you will. We give you resources to create a profile for your
		pooch with all the pertinent information, and we give you plenty of
		space to show off favorite pictures. The Most Innovative Pet Matching
		Service We want to give dog owners, enthusiasts and yes, dogs, an
		online home like no other. Our community is designed to help you find
		other nearby dogs and dog owners to set up playdates or breeding
		opportunities. We offer a number of search options so you can sort by
		location, breed, pedigree, color, age and many other criteria. This
		advanced matching system is much more effective than any classified
		ads.
